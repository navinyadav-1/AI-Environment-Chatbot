        long: "Solar energy technology uses photovoltaic (PV) cells to convert sunlight directly into electricity. When photons hit the cells, they knock electrons loose from atoms, generating an electrical flow. Modern solar panels are increasingly efficient and affordable, making them a viable option for clean energy production at both small and large scales."
